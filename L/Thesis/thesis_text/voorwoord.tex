First I would like to thank Professor De Brabanter and Professor Wauters for the chance to really dig deep into the field of machine learning.\\
These last 5 years have been hard but also really fun and full of opportunities.
I would love to thank the dreamteam: Wouter Legiest, Henri Sioen and Boris Wauters for a wonderful collaboration over the years as well as Mona Goddeau and Maxim Van Haeren for the countless long nights in the beautiful city of Ghent.\par 
I would like to thank my parents for the support over the years, my sister as a co-reader of my thesis and Charline Lo for listening to my endless worries about this document.\par 
Last but not least I would like to thank Cathy Berx for the curfew in my beloved city Antwerp, she made sure that I was not the only one spending my nights inside in August.
